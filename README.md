## My personal experiece

Codingame was my first serious approach to coding challenges and competitive programming. I dedicated a lot of my time to it and that lead me to achieve various certifications, by completing their entire questlines and some personal achievement like being in the top 1.000 Clash of Coders or in the top 0.2% programmer overall.
